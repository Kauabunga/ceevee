      EAB is a web application realised to provide value to both front end users along with those responsible for its maintenance.

      Small to medium business parties are able to use the tool to step through creating a new Employment agreement while at the
      same time educating themselves about employment law with easy to digest content and links.

      I lead the implementation design while teaching a Senior Java developer transitioning to JavaScript.
      The project ran successfully meeting its internal and external objectives finishing in three months.

      Our UX and developer streams worked well together from the start, laying foundations for one another and we managed
      to create a complete working iOS game that would quiz the user on peoples names with multiple mini-games supported by
       a global leaderboard.

      We placed well in the competition winning the prize of placing in the companies evaluation panel for future
      projects followed shortly after with a winning proposal for a separate project.

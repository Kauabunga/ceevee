    brief: `

      I joined a team at BNZ to help in transforming their Lending and Onboarding systems, aiming to improve the experience 
      for customers and bank staff. This transformation was supported by a new way of delivery, promoting more modular systems
      design and implementation with supporting Platforms and Devops processes.

      I shared the lead for the Front-end implementation of two major applications and a component library.

    brief: `

      EAB is an application for small to medium businesses to create new Employment agreements while learning
      about employment law with easy-to-digest content.
  
      I worked on this as a JavaScript developer in a small team, 
      guiding another developer and automation tester with the language and tooling.  
      
      The project exceeded its objectives and was built, tested, and delivered in three months.

    title: 'Online Banking',
    client: 'Westpac',
    brief: `

      I was part of a Westpac team to evolve their online banking experience, originally rolled in as an IBM Worklight consultant and dev ops engineer.

      I helped keep the project oiled by mediating communications between developers from API and Front-end teams.
      I improved automation in local, development, and test environments helping developers become more autonomous.

      After two months my role extended to a technical lead of a team of five, responsible for feature development in the middleware.

      NEON is Sky TV's entry into the New Zealand TV on demand market. Our project's team was responsible for

      The Crew Forms application looked to turn a paper based form into a mobile tablet-based solution.

      The experience of these forms was improved with the new technology and with a change in platform 
      the forms were able to be re-imagined to provide a better user experience.

      I worked on the project in its second phase, bringing in new features and tidying the first implementation.

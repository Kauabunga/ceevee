      EAB is a web application that provides value to front end users and those who maintain the backend.

      Using the tool, small to medium businesses can step through the process of creating a new Employment agreement while learning
      about employment law with easy-to-digest content and links.

      I led the implementation design while teaching a Senior Java developer transitioning to JavaScript.
      The project met its internal and external objectives and was finished in three months.

      through UX process to further better user experience rather than being a clone of the paper solution.

       a global leaderboard.

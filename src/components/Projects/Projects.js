    brief: `

      I was part of a Westpac project to rewrite their online banking applications originally rolled in as an IBM Worklight consultant and dev ops engineer.

      I helped keep the project oiled by mediating communications between developers from API and Client teams.
      I improved automation in local, development, and test environments, which helped developers become more autonomous providing an interface for logs, deployments, and environment stats.

      After two months I was promoted to technical lead of a team five large responsible for feature development in the middleware including client security.

      NEON is Sky TV's entry into the New Zealand TV on demand market. Our project was responsible for implementing the Web client
      and the Web API supporting other NEON apps sitting on other platforms.

      My role was a front end developer with a close interest in the Web API and UX layers that my tasks depended on.

      I was tasked with designing a set of middleware REST API based on a SAAS backend that the client layers would consume.

      I was also asked to fill gaps in the UX and design that the static wireframes designed in a separate project did not cover.

      Crew forms was a heavily digital project looking to turn a paper based form into a mobile tablet-based solution.

      The experience of these forms was improved with the new technology and with a change in platform the forms were allowed to be reimagined
      through UX process to further better user experience rather than being a clone of the paper solution.

      I worked on the project in its second phase after its first release bringing in a couple of new features and polishing the first implementation.

      We entered in a competition to imagine, design, and develop a proof of concept mobile gamification app in 3 days.

      Our UX and developer streams worked well together from the start, laying foundations for one another and we managed
      to create a complete working iOS game that would quiz the user on people's names with multiple mini-games supported by
       a global leaderboard.

      We were placed well in the competition winning the prize of placing in the company's evaluation panel for future
      projects followed shortly after with a winning proposal for a separate project.

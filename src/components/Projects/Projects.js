      EAB is a web application realised to provide value to both front end users along with those responsible for its maintenance.

      Small to medium business parties are able to use the tool to step through creating a new Employment agreement while at the
      same time educating themselves about employment law with easy to digest content and links.

      I lead the implementation design while teaching a Senior Java developer transitioning to JavaScript.
      The project ran successfully meeting its internal and external objectives finishing in three months.

    brief: `

      I became part of the Westpac project to rewrite their online banking applications originally rolled in as an IBM Worklight consultant and dev ops engineer.

      I helped keep the project oiled by mediating communications between developers from API and Client teams along with improving automation in local, developmenet, and test environments.
      This automation helped developers become more autonomous providing an interface for logs, deployments, and environment stats.

      After a couple of month went by and the teams trust in me grew I became tech lead of a team five large responsible for feature development in the middleware
      security in the client.

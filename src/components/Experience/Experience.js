    date: 'Aug 2012 - Now ( 5 years )',
    brief: `
    I started Solnet a week out from graduating kicking off the role in the delivery team of the company.

    I have gained experience with several high profile clients placed first as a developer along with other roles such as
     dev ops, ux, and tech lead.

    More recently in my time at Solnet I have been involved in mentoring team members in JavaScript tooling and practices
     through one on one catch ups and wider group presentations.

    title: 'Research Project: Query Expansion',
    date: 'Nov 2011 - March 2012 ( 4 months )',
    brief: `

    My second research opportunity was offered by the supervisor of my honours project to further its final report towards an end goal of a published research paper.
    With some give and take from the wider Web Intelligence team at Victoria I managed to get the paper submitted and accepted to an Australasian Web Intelligence conference.

    title: 'Research Project: Eye Gaze tracking',
    date: 'Nov 2010 - March 2011 ( 4 months )',
    brief: `
    I was awarded a research scholarship at the end of my 300 level university year.
    With support from my supervisor and his team,
    I contributed to development of an open source gaze tracking system helping it evolve to a level where it could benefit the university,
    saving an equivalent commercial product cost of  $10,000.

    title: 'Cool Bananas',
    date: 'Nov 2009 - March 2010 ( 4 months )',
    brief: `

    Interning with a fellow student alongside a senior software engineer I worked on a project developing a prototype scripting parser and runtime for embedded systems.
    The experience helped cement my years study learning C, Agile processes, and testing practices.
    The project proved successful gaining further funding being developed into a commercial product.

    brief: `
    
    Joining Properly with a team of 18, we've now grown to 50, working across the world to provide tools and people
    to property owners and managers.

    After achieving our Series A funding I became the lead for a small frontend team of 3, together owning the multiple web apps of Properly.

    Beyond this role, I was also heavily involved in several other parts of the wider engineering and design teams:
    Solution architecture, Fullstack development, UI test automation, Continuous Integration pipelines, and AWS Infrastructure development as code.

    date: 'Aug 2012 - Nov 2017 ( 5 years 3 months )',
    brief: `
    
    I started at Solnet a week out from graduating, kicking off the role in the delivery team of the company.

    I have gained experience with several high profile clients, placed first as a front end developer along with other roles such as
     Devops Developer, API Developer, Automation Tester, and UX Designer.

    More recently in my time at Solnet I have been mentoring team members in JavaScript 
    tooling and practices, through 1-on-1 catch ups and wider group presentations.

    title: 'Research Project: Query Expansion',
    date: 'Nov 2011 - March 2012 ( 4 months )',
    brief: `

    My second research opportunity was offered by the supervisor of my honours project.
    
    The project looked at ways that Wikipedia and its hyperlinks could be used to support 
    query expansion; by better interpreting a users query and reformulating it to improve 
    the results retrieved.  
    
    With some give-and-take from the Web Intelligence team at 
    Victoria, I managed to get the paper submitted and accepted to an 
    Australasian Web Intelligence conference.

    date: 'Nov 2010 - March 2011 ( 4 months )',
    brief: `
    At the end of my 300 level university year I was awarded a research scholarship.
    
    With the support of my supervisor and his team,
    I contributed to the development of an open source gaze tracking system.
    
    This helped it evolve to a level where it could benefit the university,
    saving an equivalent commercial product cost of approximately $10,000.

    brief: `

    During an internship with a fellow student and senior software engineer,
     we prototyped a scripting interpreter and runtime for embedded systems.
     
    The experience helped cement the years study learning C, Agile Processes, and Testing Practices.
    
    The project proved successful when it gained further funding to be developed into a commercial product.

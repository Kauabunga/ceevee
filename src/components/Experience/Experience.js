    Joining Properly, and a team of 14, we work across the world to provide tools and people
    to property owners and managers.

    After achieving our Series-A funding I became the lead for the frontend team, together owning the multiple web apps of Properly.

    Beyond this role, I was involved with more of our engineering, design, and test team activities. This included:
    Web/Service implementation design, Full stack development, UX design, UI test automation, CI pipelines, Infrastructure design, and Infrastructure as code.

    I started with Solnet a week after graduating, joining the delivery team.

    I gained experience with a variety of clients, first as a front end developer along with other roles:
     Devops developer, API developer, Automation tester, and UX designer.

    Later at my time in Solnet I mentored team members in Javascript 
    tooling and practices, through 1-on-1's and group presentations.

      I joined Properly with a team of 14, working across the world to provide tools and people
      to property owners and managers.
  
      After achieving our Series-A funding I became the lead for the frontend team, together owning the multiple web apps of Properly.
  
      Beyond this role, I was involved with more of our engineering, design, and test team activities. This included:
      Web/Service implementation design, Full stack development, UX design, UI test automation, CI pipelines, Infrastructure design, and Infrastructure as code.

      I started with Solnet after graduating, joining the delivery team.
  
      I gained experience with a variety of clients, first as a front end developer, then as others:
       Devops developer, API developer, Automation tester, and UX designer.
  
      Later at my time in Solnet I mentored team members in Javascript 
      tooling and practices, through 1-on-1's and group presentations.

      My second research opportunity was offered by the supervisor of my honours project.
      
      The project looked at ways that Wikipedia and its hyperlinks could be used to support 
      Query Expansion.  
      
      With Victoria's Web Intelligence team, I got my thesis submitted and accepted to an 
      Australasian Web Intelligence conference.

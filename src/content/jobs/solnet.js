    brief: [
      `
    I began my career at Solnet, where I joined their delivery team after graduating.
    
    While there, I gained diverse experience working with various clients, primarily as a front-end developer. 
    However, I also frequently ventured into other roles such as DevOps, API developer, and automation tester.
    
    During my tenure, I also took on the responsibility of mentoring team members in 
    JavaScript tooling and best practices through one-on-one sessions and group presentations.

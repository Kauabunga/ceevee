    brief: `
      
      I started with Solnet after graduating, joining the delivery team.
  
      I gained experience with a variety of clients, first as a front end developer, then as others:
       Devops developer, API developer and Automation tester.
  
      Later at my time in Solnet I mentored team members in JavaScript 
      tooling and practices, through 1-on-1's and group presentations.

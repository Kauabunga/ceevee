    brief: `
      
      I joined Properly with a team of 14, working across the world to provide tools and people
      to property owners and managers.
  
      After achieving our Series-A funding I became the lead for the frontend team, together owning the multiple web apps of Properly.
  
      Beyond this role, I was involved with more of our engineering, design, and test team activities. This included:
      Web/Service implementation design, Full stack development, UX design, UI test automation, CI pipelines, Infrastructure design, and Infrastructure as code.

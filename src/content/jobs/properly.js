    brief: [
      `
    
    At Properly, I joined a 14-member team working globally to provide property owners and managers with tools and support. 
    
    Following our successful Series-A funding, I witnessed the company's expansion to over 50 members.
    
    As the lead for the front-end team, I oversaw the development of multiple web apps. 
    
    In addition to this role, I actively participated in various engineering, design, and testing activities.
